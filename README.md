# World Cup 2026 Draw Simulator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.0.

This is an an Angular single page application to simulate draws of already qualified teams and projected qualified teams for the upcoming World Cup 2026 draw on December 5th.

The project is inspired by and uses the same simulation logic as https://vibedatascience.github.io/world-cup-group-visualization/. I wanted to add the ability to edit the positions of UEFA and CAF qualifying as well as the winners of the AFC Fourth round playoff, giving users more flexibility to run more simulations. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

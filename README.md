# World Cup 2026 Draw Simulator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.0.

This is an an Angular single page application to simulate draws of already qualified teams and projected qualified teams for the upcoming World Cup 2026 draw on December 5th.

The project was spun off the simulator created by https://vibedatascience.github.io/world-cup-group-visualization/. I fixed the draw simulation logic to assign playoff teams correctly and to edit the qualifying teams which were hardcoded in his solution. There are also some invalid groups which are generated by the simulation which has been fixed.

Users are able to order teams in confederations that are still undergoing qualifying and also edit the teams that will qualify for the interconfederation playoffs, giving more flexibility and opportunity to run more valid simulations.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
